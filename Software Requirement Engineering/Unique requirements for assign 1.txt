Functional Requirements

Alumni mentorship program: The portal could allow alumni to sign up as mentors or mentees, and provide a platform for them to connect and build relationships. This could be a valuable way for alumni to give back to their school and to help current students and recent graduates succeed.
Alumni job board: The portal could include a job board where alumni can post job openings and search for job opportunities. This could be a great way for alumni to find new jobs and to help their fellow alumni find employment.
Alumni social media integration: The portal could integrate with social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. This would allow alumni to share news and updates about themselves and the school with their social media networks.
Alumni event live streaming: The portal could allow alumni to live stream events such as sporting events, commencement ceremonies, and guest speaker events. This would allow alumni who are unable to attend in person to still participate in these events.
Alumni virtual community: The portal could include a virtual community where alumni can connect with each other in real time. This could be done through features such as live chat, video conferencing, and online discussion forums.
Non-Functional Requirements

Artificial intelligence (AI) powered recommendations: The portal could use AI to power recommendations for alumni. For example, the portal could recommend events based on the alumni's interests, or recommend alumni to connect with based on their shared interests and experiences.
Real-time translation: The portal could provide real-time translation of its content into multiple languages. This would allow alumni from all over the world to use the portal and connect with each other.
Offline access: The portal could provide offline access to some of its features, such as the directory and event calendar. This would allow alumni to use the portal even when they do not have an internet connection.
Gamification: The portal could use gamification elements such as badges and points to encourage alumni to participate in various activities, such as updating their profile, attending events, and connecting with other alumni.
Data analytics: The portal could collect and analyze data about alumni usage and engagement. This data could be used to improve the portal and to make it more relevant to the needs of the alumni.
These are just a few examples of unique requirements for an alumni portal. The specific requirements for any particular portal will vary depending on the needs of the school and its alumni.
